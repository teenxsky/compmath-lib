"""
CompMath (Computational Mathematics) - Library for complex mathematical calculations

This library provides tools to perform calculations in the field
computing mathematics, including numerical methods, linear algebra,
Interpolation, integration and solution of differential equations.

Basic possibilities:
- Numerical methods for solving equations
- Linear algebra (matrices, vectors, operations)
- Interpolation and approximation of functions
- Numerical integration and differentiation
- Solution of ordinary differential equations (ode)

Modules:
- `faults`: a module for calculation faults.
